Here are my solutions for AOC 2024. 

I do not try to optimise my code. I go with first idea I get. Some solutions are horrible implementations, \
because I misread the task but did not bother to rewrite it from scratch.

If I can't figure it out, I look up others people solutions and adapt it (I try to understand what they did and then do it myself). \
So some tasks I would fail on my own: Day17 part2, Day23 part2 and Day24 part2.

\
\
I enjoyed doing these tasks even tho I prefer coding rather than math/algorithmic tasks. Hence, I enjoyed \
mostly tasks 10-20. First ones were too easy and last ones were too much about knowledge of the math/algorithm. \
There was a lot of maze problems, but I liked that, because these tasks are about complex algorithms that you \
don't need to solve properly, just refine them until it works and I love that. :P
