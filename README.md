Here are my solutions for AOC 2024. 

I do not try to optimise my code. I go with first idea I get. Some solutions are horrible implementations, \
because I misread the task but did not bother to rewrite it.

If I can't figure it out, I look up others people solutions and adapt it. So some tasks I would fail on my own. These are: \
Day17 part2, Day23 part2, Day24 part2.
